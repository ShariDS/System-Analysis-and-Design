# System-Analysis-and-Design
CS-255

# This project was to create a website for a student driver training program. The client and owner of the project was Liam and his IT assistant Ian. They named their system DriverPass. They wanted DriverPass to have learning modules with practice tests and a calender where they can book driving lessons. 

# I got particularly good at creating UML diagrams.

# To improve upon my work, I’d like to dig deeper for a greater understanding of the website technical requirements. To do that I can review the materials of the course, write down questions, and research those questions. Then I would review my paper and revise it with more specific detail.

# It is important to consider the user’s needs, because it is good business to create a smooth and efficient customer experience. I interpreted the user’s needs to be able to intuitively navigate the system and access the training tools needed to meet their goals. 

# A good strategy for analyzing and designing a system is to gather all the known requirements for the system, break down the steps and create a timeline. I would create diagrams that showcase what the system will do and how the process would flow. I would want to be careful to build the system with all my clients requirements accounted for.
